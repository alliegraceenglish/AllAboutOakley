              <h3>A Typical Day</h3>
              <p>A typical day for Oakley begins with a trip outside. While she loves to smell and explore, she knows breakfast is her next stop,
              so she usually gets down to taking care of business pretty quickly. After her outdoor excursion, Oakley helps herself to a big bowl
              of her favorite dog food. After breakfast, Oakley typically enjoys a nice long drink and does some exploring around the house. Once she's
              satisfied everything is safe and sound, Oakley might go back to sleep on her special blanket if her humans are still around.</p>
              <p>Sometimes Oakley spends the day at her favorite doggie day care where she gets to play with all her puppy and people friends</p>

              be a doctor. He studies a lot and works really hard. Allie has a neat job and is learning all about business. They really love Oakley,
